# Skilled

A static site generator where AI agent skills replace the framework.

## What This Is

You tell an AI agent what you want. The agent reads skills — folders with instructions, scripts, and references — and does the work. Standard HTML and CSS come out. No templating language, no framework API.

- **Skills replace the framework.** Every capability (scaffolding, page creation, image generation, issue triage) is a skill folder with a `SKILL.md`, scripts, and reference materials.
- **The agent is the interface.** Claude Code, Codex, and similar agents discover skills in their native directories (`.claude/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`). The agent reads `SKILL.md` and acts.
- **Drop-in by design.** This project only uses skills + scripts: repo-contained, works immediately with minimal agent-specific setup. MCP is not prioritized because it still requires agent-specific tool registration and authentication setup.
- **You own the output.** Plain HTML, CSS, and config files. No proprietary format, no runtime dependency.
- **Core skills update cleanly.** `_core/` updates via `git merge` without touching your content.

Frameworks give developers abstractions to code against. Skills give agents instructions to act on. The unit of reuse is a workflow, not a library.

## How It Compares

|  | **Skilled** | **Jekyll / Hugo / 11ty** |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Static output, simple hosting | Yes | Yes |
| No database required | Yes | Yes |
| Natural language authoring | Yes | No |
| AI-native workflow (scaffold, create, build) | Yes | No |
| Framework/templating language to learn | No | Yes |
| Content generated, not just templated | Yes | No |
| Built-in image generation | Yes | No |
| Built-in issue triage | Yes | No |

**Trade-offs:**

- **Requires an AI agent.** Without one, you can still `npm run build`, but you lose the skill-powered workflow.
- **Skills are natural language.** Different agents may interpret `SKILL.md` differently.
- **No incremental builds.** Full copy of `src/` to `dist/` every time.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx degit helincao/skilled my-site
cd my-site
npm install

# In Claude Code:
/start-project
```

The agent asks what your site is about, then:

1. Creates `site.config.json`
2. Scaffolds `_partials/header.html` and `footer.html`
3. Generates `src/index.html` — a real page, not a placeholder
4. Sets up `src/css/input.css` with brand tokens
5. Runs the build to produce `dist/`

Without an agent: `npm run build` runs `skilled-build` from `skilled`.

No `src/`, no `_partials/`, no `site.config.json` yet. `/start-project` creates those.

**The rule:** `_core/` is upstream. Everything else is yours.

## Skills

A skill is a folder:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Instructions for the agent (required)
├── scripts/              # CLI tools the agent runs (optional)
│   └── my-tool.mjs
└── references/           # Context documents (optional)
```

### SKILL.md specification

Every skill needs a `SKILL.md`. This is the contract between the skill and the agent.

| Section | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Title and summary** | Yes | One-line description |
| **When to use** | Yes | Trigger conditions |
| **Inputs** | Yes | What the skill needs (user input, files, env vars) |
| **Steps** | Yes | Ordered instructions |
| **Output** | Yes | What the skill produces (files, side effects) |
| **Conventions** | No | Project-specific rules |
| **Examples** | No | Sample invocations |

**Scripts** are plain Node.js CLI tools. Node.js built-ins only (plus declared `package.json` dependencies). Input via CLI args, output to stdout or files. Exit 0 on success, non-zero on failure.

**References** are static files the agent reads for context. Never executed.

### Discovery

Agents scan their native directory (`.claude/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`). Each entry is either:

- **A symlink** to `_core/skills/<name>` — core skill, updates via merge
- **A real folder** — your custom skill, upstream never touches it

Run `npm run setup:skills` (or `node _core/setup-skills.mjs`) after pulling upstream updates to create symlinks for new core skills.

### Dependencies between skills

Skills can depend on other skills. `create-page` produces a source file that needs `build` to appear in `dist/`. Dependencies are documented in each `SKILL.md`. The agent chains skills in the right order — no automatic resolution.

### Included skills

| Skill | Invoke | What it does | Env vars |
|---|---|---|---|
| `start-project` | `/start-project` | Scaffolds full project structure from a description | — |
| `build` | `/build` | Compiles CSS, injects partials and SEO into `dist/`, generates sitemap and robots.txt | — |
| `create-page` | `/create-page` | Authors a new HTML page following project conventions | — |
| `github-issues` | `/github-issues` | Triages and addresses GitHub issues | `GITHUB_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` |
| `image-gen` | `/image-gen` | Generates images via AI (Google Gemini) | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |

Copy `.env-example` to `.env` and fill in the values for skills that need them.

### Custom skills

Create a folder in `.claude/skills/` with a `SKILL.md`. Follow the spec above. Custom skills are real folders, not symlinks — upstream updates never touch them.

## Security

Skills are scripts that run on your machine with your user permissions. Same trust model as npm packages.

- **Review before merging.** Check `git diff` on `_core/` before running new skills.
- **API keys are shared.** All skills can read `.env`. Don't store secrets beyond what skills require.
- **Scripts run unsandboxed.** A compromised skill has full user-level access.
- **Custom skills are your responsibility.** Core skills are maintained upstream. Custom skills are on you.

## Upstream Updates

`_core/` updates via `git merge`. You never edit `_core/`, so merges are clean.

```bash
# One-time: add remote
git remote add skilled https://github.com/helincao/skilled.git

# Update
git fetch skilled
git merge skilled/main

# Review
git diff HEAD~1 -- _core/

# Symlink new skills
npm run setup:skills
```

### Ejecting a skill

To customize a core skill, copy it out of `_core/`:

```bash
cp -r _core/skills/build .claude/skills/build
# The real folder replaces the symlink
```

That skill is now yours. Upstream changes won't affect it. Ejection is one-way — no mechanism to selectively merge upstream changes back in.

## Deployment

Point any static host at `dist/`. Build command is `npm run build` everywhere. Build generates `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` automatically.

Works with Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, GitHub Pages, Vercel — anything that serves static files.

## Limitations

- **No incremental builds.** Full `src/` copy every time. Fine for most sites.
- **No content lifecycle.** No drafts, no scheduling. Files exist or they don't.
- **No asset pipeline.** No image optimization, no responsive images, no minification beyond Tailwind.
- **No skill versioning.** No semver, no changelog. Review diffs before merging.
- **Single-agent workflow.** No multi-agent coordination. Use git for conflicts.
- **Agent portability varies.** Tested with Claude Code. Other agents may interpret skills differently.

## Contributing

File issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/helincao/skilled). For code: fork, feature branch, keep `_core/skills/` generic, test with a fresh clone + `/start-project`, submit a PR.

**Guidelines:**

- Everything is a skill. New capabilities go in `_core/skills/<name>/`.
- Skills are self-contained. `SKILL.md` alone should be enough.
- Follow the spec. Required sections: title, when to use, inputs, steps, output.
- Zero build dependencies. Node.js built-ins only. Tailwind is the sole project dependency.

### Backlog

Priority order.

| # | Feature | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Complete core skill set** | `build`, `github-issues`, and `image-gen` are in `_core/skills/`; add `start-project` and `create-page` for full parity with README examples. |
| 2 | **Improve `setup-skills.mjs` lifecycle** | Add stale-link cleanup and richer reporting so upgrades stay deterministic in long-lived repos. |
| 3 | **Build-time validation** | Check well-formed HTML, required meta fields, broken links, missing images before they reach `dist/`. |
| 4 | **`SKILL.md` linter** | Validate skills against the spec — required sections present. Run in CI or standalone. |
| 5 | **Incremental builds** | Track file hashes. Only process changed files. Matters past ~50 pages. |
| 6 | **Changelog and release tags** | Semver tags and `CHANGELOG.md` in `_core/` so consumers know what changed. |
| 7 | **Draft support** | `draft: true` in the meta block. Build skips drafts from `dist/` and `sitemap.xml`. |
| 8 | **Asset optimization** | Image compression, `srcset`, cache-busting hashes. New `optimize` skill or extend `build`. |
| 9 | **Agent adapter system** | Detect `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/`, etc. and create symlinks in each. |
| 10 | **Skill test harness** | Fixtures (input + expected output) in `tests/` per skill. Run via `node _core/test-skills.mjs`. |
